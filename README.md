# Iris-Flower-Predictor

This repository contains the source code and presentation for the analysis of an open-source dataset using supervised machine learning techniques, specifically Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers, to train and evaluate classifiers for species prediction. The dataset is available on kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset/data.
I performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on the input data, removed duplicates and checked for missing values. Also, I used various graphical representations of the data in order to better understand the distribution of the data and relations between the caracteristics of the flower. The code was initially developed in Jupyter Notebook, later being also implemented and finalized in Kaggle. The version uploaded here was written and executed on Kaggle. Fore more details please check the presentation, I uploaded only the PDF version of it.
